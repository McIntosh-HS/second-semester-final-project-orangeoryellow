        <p>The overall course was pretty fun for me. I learned a lot of new things and this class helps me to understand and get interested in computer and programming more. I have struggled with several assignments, but Mr. Murry has helped me kindly and I have always felt the benefit and purpose behind every assignment. Also, the teacher, Mr. Murry is so good teacher making jokes and friendly. I really like this course and I'm gonna take AP computer science principle, so it is definitely helpful for me.</p>
        <p>In this course, I learned software & hardware of the computer. I disassembeld computer to know what parts they were and the pupose of each part, and used codeHS to know how each part looks like before disassembling. It was hard to determine what parts they were beacuse I didn't have knowledge about computer. It was my first time to disassemble and learn. However, after I learend, I got interested in computer parts like cpu, ssd, and mainboard. </p>
        <p>In this course, I learned Javascript. It is one of the programming languages. I was learnig this by uisng codeHS and virtual box. It is one of the most famous programming languages, so many websites use it and it is good to know how to use and program. It was easy to program because I used to learn programming in Korea. I liked to prgramm in this class the most.</p>
        <p>In this course, I learned how to desgin website. It is the easiest thing beacuse making websoite has given information how to do. </p>
